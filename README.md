# Vaccine Passport Validator Management Application WIP!!

The Application is made for The Department of Healthcare Republic of Poland, be wary that this app is not the actual application version that I made for them
there are a lot of difference such as the styling library, component and features pattern, database (the actual database is not MongoDB) i use mongodb for
creating this prototype app only to show how the app works in general, and last but not least is the packages/library.
